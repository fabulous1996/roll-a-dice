# roll-a-dice

Project in Javascript from Jonas Schmedtmann Javascript course on Udemy
This dice game is played by two players. Roll the dice by pressing the "ROLL DICE" button; your score after each roll will appear in the "current" box. If the number you roll equals 1, your current score resets to zero, and it's your opponent's turn to play.
To lock in your score, press the "HOLD" button.
The first player to reach 50 points wins the game.
